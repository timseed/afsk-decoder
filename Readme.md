#AFSK for Qt 

Ported from [https://github.com/hedin-hiervard/afsk-decoder](https://github.com/hedin-hiervard/afsk-decoder).


## Porting to QT

Very very clean code - well written. I just had to "QT" the Command line parser.... 

I also added the AudioFile.h (Also lovely code) written by @author Adam Stark, this code appeared with the recursive Git Fetch from the original project.


## Mac M1 QT 6

Compiles, very clean and simple. No Warnings. I have not converted the std::cout to QT, as it accomplishes very little.
